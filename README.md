# flood_prediction

From Kaggle's 'playground' competitions, starting May 2024 (S4E5).

Like I wrote to last month's, note that I plan on also posting this on their website, well at least their code. However, I'll wait to do so until I've finished (5/1/24). Truthfully, I did not bother to do so with the last one, having performed so poorly (in my opinion), despite the work that I still truly admire. Likely this time I will force myself to do something 'fancy' this time, which basically every single person did in the abalone competition last month...
